# chess-infrastructure

Kubernetes infrastructure for a chess web application. This repository is the final deployment layer that unifies four microservices into a running cluster.

## Architecture

Four microservices deployed on Kubernetes:

| Service | Image | Replicas | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `chess-auth-service` | `ghcr.io/shyrimon2000-tech/chess-auth-service` | 1 | Authentication, JWT, user management |
| `chess-room-service` | `ghcr.io/shyrimon2000-tech/chess-room-service` | 2 | Matchmaking, room lifecycle |
| `chess-game-service` | `ghcr.io/shyrimon2000-tech/chess-game-service` | 3 | Game logic, WebSocket, move processing |
| `chess-frontend-service` | `ghcr.io/shyrimon2000-tech/chess-frontend-service` | 1 | React/static frontend |

Each backend service runs on port `8000`. MySQL 8.0 per service (no shared database). Redis for game state pub/sub.

## Environments

| | Dev | Staging | Prod |
|---|---|---|---|
| Cluster | EKS shared | EKS shared | EKS dedicated |
| Namespace | `dev` | `staging` | `default` |
| Frontend | container | container | S3 + CloudFront |
| Database | in-cluster MySQL | in-cluster MySQL | RDS |
| Redis | in-cluster | in-cluster | ElastiCache |
| DB Storage | EBS gp3 | EBS gp3 | managed (RDS) |
| HPA | disabled | enabled | enabled |
| Replicas | 1 per service | minReplicas (HPA) | minReplicas (HPA) |
| ResourceQuota | low (1 replica) | based on maxReplicas | based on maxReplicas |
| Ingress | nginx | nginx | ALB |
| Secrets | plain Secret | plain Secret | ESO → AWS Secrets Manager |

### Network Policy egress

Service pods (auth, game, room) have egress rules that adapt to the environment:

- **Dev / Staging** (`db.enabled: true`) — egress to database and Redis pods is restricted by `podSelector`, allowing traffic only to the specific in-cluster pods.
- **Prod** (`db.enabled: false`) — egress uses `ipBlock` with a configurable VPC CIDR (`db.cidr` for RDS on port 3306, `redisCidr` for ElastiCache on port 6379), restricting outbound traffic to the VPC private subnets only. Default placeholder is `10.0.0.0/16` — replace with the actual subnet CIDRs once the VPC is provisioned by Terraform.

This is controlled automatically via the `db.enabled` flag — no manual NetworkPolicy changes needed when switching environments.

### HPA Configuration (Staging / Prod)

| Service | Min Replicas | Max Replicas | Target CPU |
|---|---|---|---|
| auth | 1 | 3 | 70% |
| room | 2 | 4 | 65% |
| game | 3 | 6 | 60% |

Game has the lowest CPU threshold (60%) because it handles real-time WebSocket connections — scaling earlier avoids latency spikes under load.

### ResourceQuota

| | Dev | Staging | Prod |
|---|---|---|---|
| requests.cpu | 1300m | 3100m | 2300m |
| requests.memory | 2900Mi | 5000Mi | 2700Mi |
| limits.cpu | 2700m | 6500m | 4900m |
| limits.memory | 4200Mi | 8200Mi | 5300Mi |

Prod quota is lower than staging despite having HPA enabled — no in-cluster MySQL pods (3 × 200m CPU / 600Mi each) since databases run on RDS.

### Access

**Dev / Staging** — internal only, not exposed to the internet.

- **CI/CD access** — self-hosted ECS Fargate runner in private subnet (runs `terragrunt apply`, `helm`, `kubectl`)
- **Admin/developer access** — WireGuard VPN into the VPC (Terraform module planned); once connected, all private resources are reachable directly

Planned hostnames (Route53 private hosted zone, not yet provisioned):
- `dev.chess.internal` → dev namespace
- `staging.chess.internal` → staging namespace

Both point to the nginx ingress on the shared EKS cluster. Traffic stays within the VPC.

**Prod** — public via ALB + Route53 public hosted zone. TLS terminated at the ALB.

## Project Roadmap

- [x] Kubernetes manifests — secrets, configmaps, statefulsets, deployments, services, ingress, network policies, resource quota, limit range
- [x] Helm charts — packaging manifests for reusable deployment
- [x] Terraform — cloud infrastructure provisioning (VPC, EKS, Karpenter, NodePools, ECS runner)
- [ ] GitHub Actions — CD pipeline (3-layer architecture, ECS runner written)

## Terraform

Cloud infrastructure provisioned with Terraform + Terragrunt. State stored in S3 (`chess-terraform-state-221556121262`, us-east-1, versioning enabled).

### Bootstrap (one-time, per AWS account)

These resources must exist before the first `terragrunt apply`. They store Terraform state and locks — they cannot be managed by Terraform itself (chicken-and-egg).

```bash
# S3 bucket for state (versioning enabled, encryption at rest)
aws s3api create-bucket \
  --bucket chess-terraform-state-221556121262 \
  --region us-east-1

aws s3api put-bucket-versioning \
  --bucket chess-terraform-state-221556121262 \
  --versioning-configuration Status=Enabled
```

State locking uses native S3 conditional writes (`use_lockfile = true` in `terraform/root.hcl`) — no DynamoDB table required. Requires Terraform ≥ 1.10.

Apply order (Layer 0 — GitHub-hosted runner): `vpc → ecs-runner`

Apply order (Layer 1 — self-hosted Fargate runner): `eks → karpenter → nodepools`

### Architectural Decisions

**VPC**
- Two VPCs: `shared` (10.0.0.0/16) for dev+staging, `prod` (192.168.0.0/16) for production
- 3 public + 3 private subnets across 3 AZs in each VPC
- `prod` additionally has 3 database subnets for RDS
- Single NAT gateway per VPC (cost optimization — acceptable for this project scale)

**EKS — two-tier compute model**

No managed node groups. System components run on Fargate, app workloads on EC2 provisioned by Karpenter.

| Tier | Components | Compute |
|------|-----------|---------|
| Fargate | Karpenter controller, ArgoCD, Grafana, CoreDNS | Fargate micro-VM per pod |
| EC2 (Karpenter) | All chess microservices, Prometheus | Spot (shared) / on-demand (prod) |

- Private API endpoint only (`endpoint_public_access = false`) — access via self-hosted ECS Fargate runner in private subnet
- IRSA used for Karpenter IAM (pod identity not used — EKS pod identity agent not available on Fargate at time of writing)
- Addons: CoreDNS (Fargate), kube-proxy, VPC CNI, EBS CSI Driver
- CoreDNS runs on Fargate via `kube-system` Fargate profile (label: `k8s-app=kube-dns`) to bootstrap DNS before Karpenter provisions EC2 nodes

**Karpenter**
- Single `general` NodePool — all chess services bin-packed on the same nodes
- Instance types: t3/t3a medium+large (x86, amd64 only)
- **shared**: Spot instances — cost optimized, interruptions acceptable in dev/staging
- **prod**: on-demand instances — no interruptions for active game sessions and room state (Redis)
- Consolidation: `WhenEmptyOrUnderutilized`, consolidateAfter 30s
- Node limits: 8 CPU / 32Gi memory

**Frontend**
- Prod: S3 + CloudFront (static assets, no pod in cluster)
- Dev / Staging: container in EKS (shared cluster)

### Progress

| Module | Status |
|---|---|
| S3 state bucket | done (manual) |
| VPC (shared + prod) | written, validate ✓ |
| EKS (shared + prod) | written, plan verified |
| Karpenter (shared + prod) | written, validate ✓ |
| NodePools (shared + prod) | written, validate ✓ |
| ECS runner (shared + prod) | written, validate ✓ |
| RDS (prod) | not started |
| ElastiCache / Redis (prod) | not started |
| ALB Ingress Controller | not started |
| Route53 / DNS | not started |
| S3 + CloudFront (prod frontend) | not started |

> Modules are written but not yet applied. `terragrunt apply` will be run via GitHub Actions workflows once the CD pipeline is in place.

## GitHub Actions CD

Three-layer deployment model. Each layer is independent — no circular dependencies.

| Layer | Workflow | Runner | Does |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 — Bootstrap | `bootstrap-infrastructure.yml` | GitHub-hosted (`ubuntu-latest`) | `terragrunt apply` for VPC + ECS runner |
| 1 — Cluster | `deploy-cluster.yml` | Self-hosted ECS Fargate (private subnet) | `terragrunt apply` for EKS → Karpenter → NodePools |
| 2 — App delivery | ArgoCD (git push trigger) | ArgoCD pod on Fargate | Syncs chess microservices |

Layer 0 uses a standard GitHub-hosted runner because VPC and ECS runner do not require access to the EKS private API. Once the ECS runner is provisioned, Layer 1 runs inside the VPC where the private EKS endpoint is reachable.

Auth: AWS OIDC — no long-lived credentials stored in GitHub secrets.

## Applying Manifests

```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s/secrets/
kubectl apply -f k8s/configmaps/
kubectl apply -f k8s/persistentvolumes/
kubectl apply -f k8s/statefulsets/
kubectl apply -f k8s/deployments/
kubectl apply -f k8s/services/
kubectl apply -f k8s/networkpolices/
kubectl apply -f k8s/resourcequotas/
kubectl apply -f k8s/limitranges/
kubectl apply -f k8s/ingress/
```

Order matters: secrets and configmaps before deployments, PVs before statefulsets.

## Local Cluster Setup (kubeadm)

### Node labels for database placement

```bash
kubectl label node wn1 db-group=group-1   # auth-db, room-db
kubectl label node wn2 db-group=group-2   # game-db, redis
```

### Required directories on worker nodes

On `wn1`:
```bash
mkdir -p /mnt/data/auth-db /mnt/data/room-db
```

On `wn2`:
```bash
mkdir -p /mnt/data/game-db /mnt/data/redis
```

### Ingress controller

```bash
helm/install-ingress-controller.sh
kubectl patch svc ingress-nginx-controller -n ingress-nginx -p '{"spec": {"type": "NodePort"}}'
```

### Metrics server

```bash
helm/install-metrics-server.sh
```

Enables `kubectl top pods` and `kubectl top nodes` for real-time resource consumption. Required for HorizontalPodAutoscaler.

The script patches metrics-server with `--kubelet-insecure-tls` to handle self-signed kubelet certificates common in kubeadm clusters.


### External Access via VPN + Caddy

After the local cluster is running, external HTTPS access was set up without a cloud load balancer:

**Stack:** WireGuard VPN + Caddy reverse proxy (running on a separate VPS).

**Traffic flow:**
```
Browser → HTTPS → Caddy (VPS) → WireGuard tunnel → cp:31857 → nginx ingress → services
```

**Setup steps:**

1. Install WireGuard on control plane:
```bash
yum install wireguard-tools -y
```

2. Configure `/etc/wireguard/wg0.conf` — set `AllowedIPs = 10.8.0.0/24` (VPN subnet only, not `0.0.0.0/0`) and add `PersistentKeepalive = 25` to keep the tunnel alive.

3. Enable WireGuard on startup:
```bash
systemctl enable wg-quick@wg0
```

4. Pin Calico to the physical interface so it doesn't pick up the WireGuard IP:
```bash
kubectl set env daemonset/calico-node -n kube-system IP_AUTODETECTION_METHOD=interface=ens160 -n kube-system
```

5. Add Caddy reverse proxy block on the VPS:
```
chess.yourdomain.com {
    reverse_proxy <cp-vpn-ip>:31857
}
```

Caddy handles TLS termination automatically via Let's Encrypt. The cluster only receives plain HTTP on the NodePort.

**Warning:** Using `AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0` on the control plane will route all traffic through the WireGuard tunnel, breaking Calico BGP and taking down pod networking. Always use the VPN subnet only.

## Troubleshooting

### Tables do not exist on first deploy

**Symptom:** `ProgrammingError: Table 'x_db.users' doesn't exist` in service logs.

**Cause:** Alembic migrations have not run. The service starts before the database schema is initialized.

**Solution:** Each deployment (auth, room, game) has an `initContainer` that runs `alembic upgrade head` before the main container starts. If migrations fail, check the init container logs:
```bash
kubectl logs <pod-name> -c migrate
```

---

### Static assets (CSS/JS) return 404

**Symptom:** Frontend loads as unstyled HTML, CSS and JS files return 404.

**Cause:** The ingress regex pattern `/(/|$)(.*)` only matches `/` and `//something`, not paths like `/css/style.css`.

**Solution:** Frontend ingress path changed to `/(.*)` with `rewrite-target: /$1`.

---

### API routes return 404 or wrong path

**Symptom:** Room service returns 404 on `/api/rooms/rooms`.

**Cause:** `API.ROOMS = '/api/rooms'` in the frontend, so calls like `${API.ROOMS}/rooms` produce `/api/rooms/rooms`. The ingress must account for this double segment.

**Solution:** Ingress path for rooms set to `/api/rooms/(rooms.*)` → rewrite `/$1` → service receives `/rooms`.

---

### WebSocket connection lost immediately

**Symptom:** Game page shows "connection lost" on load.

**Cause:** WebSocket connects to `/api/game/ws/games/{id}` but the ingress path `/api/game/(game.*)` does not match paths starting with `ws/`.

**Solution:** Ingress path changed to `/api/game/(.*)` to cover both REST (`/games/...`) and WebSocket (`/ws/games/...`) routes.

---

### PersistentVolume not binding

**Symptom:** StatefulSet pod stuck in `Pending` with `unbound PersistentVolumeClaims`.

**Cause:** `hostPath` PVs are node-local. Without `nodeAffinity` on the PV and `nodeSelector` on the StatefulSet, the pod may be scheduled on a node where the directory does not exist.

**Solution:** Each PV has `nodeAffinity` matching `db-group` label. Each StatefulSet has a matching `nodeSelector`.

---

### Redis memory pressure

**Symptom:** Redis pod is scheduled correctly but evicts neighbor pods under load.

**Cause:** Redis configured with `--maxmemory 256mb` but `requests.memory` was set to `128Mi`, so the scheduler underestimates actual usage.

**Solution:** `requests.memory` set to `280Mi` (256mb data + ~24Mi overhead). `limits.memory` set to `300Mi`.

---

### Fewer replicas running than desired (quota exceeded)

**Symptom:** `kubectl get pods` shows fewer running replicas than declared. `kubectl get events --field-selector reason=FailedCreate` shows quota errors with memory values much higher than declared in the manifest.

**Cause:** initContainers in auth, room, and game deployments had no explicit `resources` block. The namespace LimitRange auto-injects default values into any container without explicit resources (in this cluster: `410Mi` request / `478Mi` limit for memory). The effective pod resource is `max(initContainer, mainContainer)`, so pods consumed significantly more quota than what the main container declared.

**Solution:** Add explicit `resources` to all initContainers. For `alembic upgrade head`, lean values are sufficient:
```yaml
resources:
  requests:
    memory: "128Mi"
    cpu: "50m"
  limits:
    memory: "256Mi"
    cpu: "150m"
```

Always declare `resources` on every container you control — including initContainers. LimitRange defaults are a safety net for unknown containers, not a substitute for explicit declarations.

---

### Rolling update stuck after fixing initContainer resources

**Symptom:** After fixing initContainer resources and running `kubectl apply`, the deployment stays at partial replicas. New pods fail with quota exceeded despite the fix.

**Cause:** The existing pod was created before the fix and still holds quota based on old resource specs. Rolling update cannot proceed: it needs to create a new pod first (maxUnavailable=0 by default), but quota is blocked by the old pod's inflated reservation.

**Solution:** Scale to 0, then back to the desired replica count:
```bash
kubectl scale deployment/<name> --replicas=0
kubectl scale deployment/<name> --replicas=<desired>
```
